# EXAMPLE

# USER REQUEST #: <A image here> Who had the same game version as John Roth?

THOUGHT 0: To identify who had the same game version as John Roth, I need to focus on the 'Game Version' column and the 'Manager Name' column. Also, I need to focus on all the rows so I do not need to focus on some specific rows. I can see the 'Game Version' column and the 'Manager Name' column more clearly. The game version of John Roth is 'v1.2'. Other people with the same game version are 'Alice Smith' and 'Bob Johnson'.

ANSWER: 'Alice Smith' and 'Bob Johnson' had the same game version as John Roth are. FINAL ANSWER: Alice Smith||Bob Johnson. TERMINATE
