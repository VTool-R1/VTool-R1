# News

- [2025/5/31] Training and eval code available. (We are working on releasing better model checkpoints. Stay Tuned!) <!--<span style="color: red;">[**New!**]</span>-->
- [2025/5/25] ArXiv preprint available. (Under Contruction. We will keep updating the best results.)


# Introduction

We introduce VTool-R1, one of the first frameworks that trains VLMs to generate multimodal chains of thought by interleaving text and intermediate visual reasoning steps. VTool-R1 integrates Python-based visual editing tools into the RFT process, enabling VLMs to learn when and how to generate visual reasoning steps that benefit final reasoning. Trained with outcome-based rewards tied to task accuracy, our approach elicits strategic visual tool use for reasoning without relying on process-based supervision. Experiments on structured visual question answering over charts and tables show that VTool-R1 enhances reasoning performance by teaching VLMs to "think with images" and generate multimodal chain of thoughts with tools.

VTool-R1 7B achieved a **71.7%** accuracy on the ReFOCUS-TableVQA dataset. Which is **10% higher** than the base accuracy of 64.7% using Qwen2.5-VL.

## Installation

```
conda create -n vtool python=3.10
conda activate vtool
pip install torch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 torchaudio==2.5.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
pip install hf_transfer vllm==0.8.3 triton==3.1.0
pip install -e .
```

## Data Preparation (ReFocus)

```
pip install gdown

bash prepare_refocus_data.sh

python chartqa_dataset_creator.py
```

The datasets should be organized into the following structure:

- datasets
  - val_full.parquet
  - train_full.parquet
  - test_full.parquet
  - table_train.parquet
  - table_test.parquet

Alternatively, we provide [preprocessed dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16tP_cH-9kGFzjyAn3_z1wo7HQaa9T7MY?usp=share_link) in parquet format.

## Training

Sample training scripts for 3B and 7B are available.

For reference, we trained our 3B models using 8xH100, 7B with 16xH100, both with mixed precision, and 32B with 8 H200 using BF16 precision. You may consider tuning global_batch_size and micro_batch_size_per_device_for_update to reduce VRAM usage. 

Visual tokens for TableQA are often longer, it is recommended to reduce your batch size by half when switching from ChartQA to TableQA.

3B and 7B models require a minimum of 4xH100 and 8xH100 respectively. Training using our specs typically complete within 24 hours.

Due to the nature of our dataset, we used an small LLM as our training verifier. Specifically, Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. We recommend either a single H100 or two A100 for stable training (relative to our training specs, e.g. you may find a single A100 or 4090 sufficient for 4xH100 training). 

You need to first launch the judge using our scripts run_judge.sh and then include your judge host name in judge/judge_info.json. We provide a script judge/test.py to test whether your judge was successfully deployed or not.

By default, the code assumes your judge and training job runs on the same local network, via port 7999. You may change the port if 7999 is taken.

Alternatively, we provide an option to use ngrok (a tunnel service) if your judge server is on a different network, refer to examples/reward_function/refocus_llm.py to configure your ngrok domain. You will also need to set the environment variable NGROK=YES.

If you lack the infrastructure to utilize an LLM judge, you may alternatively resort to an exact string match reward function, which can be done by switching refocus_llm.py to refocus.py in your config script. Note that this will have a negative impact on training performance.

## Questions

Please open an issue if your have any questions.

## Model Use and Evaluation

We provide 3B, 7B, and 32B model weights on ChartQA and TableQA datasets from ReFocus. Download them from [Hugging Face].

Evaluation scripts are in the eval folder. For evaluation, we use ChatGPT from OpenAI as the judge. Please configure your own API keys.
